        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administrationüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I came from a small town nobody knew much about. A 
        town where once you graduated you knew your next stop was working in the
        factories. But I knew I did not want that. I would not accept that as my
        future. I grew up seeing the media constantly talk about people who were
        successful. I aspired to be them. Of course, I did not want to be a 
        celebrity, a model, or a reality star. What I wanted was to work in a 
        big corporate business and hopefully be CEO. I saw many lifetime movies 
        where the character in the film was a business women living her life as 
        she pleased. All those women did not have to depend on a man for 
        anything. They were independent and that was the person I knew I wanted 
        to be. Traveling the world, buying anything my heart desires, living in 
        a white wrapped around porch house. I wanted the American dream. Many 
        people said my dream was too big for a small town girl. As a kid growing
        up I was not given much hope. However, senior year in high school, 
        Gabriella Union came to our school as a guest speaker. News reaporters 
        for once in my life were in my small town because a celebrity was in our
        gymansiam. She talked about how she was constanly put down by others and
        at times she felt too small in this world, but she said look at me know.
        Gabriella Union has done so much in hollywood all while having a college
        degree just incase things didnt go her way. Having Gabriella Union as a
        guest speaker, gave me hope I can turn out like her and make it big in
        life. Despite what people in my small town told me, I choose not to 
        listen to them and further my education. I am currently a business major
        student and in love with my business course classes. I enjoy learning 
        all the information especially when it comes to accounting. Which was an
        extreme surprise to me because I hated math since middle school. But 
        this is something different something I enjoy and see myself doing for a
        living. I will not confirm to the stereotypes of living in a small town.
        I will make it out that town one day and put my name on the map. I will 
        be the first of many of my family to reach for my dreams and become 
        successful in life. I will go back to that small town and encourage 
        others to explore the many opportunities life gives you if you look for 
        them. I am still not the person I want to be, but I am one step closer. 
        I have two more years of college and many more years to find that 
        perfect job to fulfill my dreams.  I want to prove people wrong. I want 
        to be one of those succes stories that people constantly talk about. But
        most importantly I want to make my family proud.<br><br>

        Although I am proud of how far I have made it in life so far, I still get discouraged. I feel lost at times. Especially with the college life. For example, adjusting the quarter system, registering for classes, becoming independent. It sounds easier than what it looks. Definitely was an extreme challenge to overcome. Everything was new to me. It is not like I could give a call to a family member and ask for help, all the could possibly say was oh I do not know sweetie did you try to google it? They could not help me because some never attended high school and others who had gotten a high school diploma did not go to college.Luckily somehow i nam doing it. With the help of on college campus resources i am able to thrive in my classes. Also friends really help and serve as motivation. Because you realize you are all trying to cross that finish line. But what better way of doing it by crossing it all together. I was the first. Being the first is scary, I feel like millions of eyes are just looking at me. Some encouraging me others putting me down. I will admit sometimes people negative comments, such as ‚Äúyou are wasting your time, you are a girl you do not belong in school, why cant you be like the rest of us and do this‚Äù all these comments bring me down. But they also serve as a motivation. A motivation of yes I know I am the first but the first of many. I am creating a path for the future generations can hopefully follow. And if they ever need help they know they can give me a call and I will lend  a helping hand. I will not put them down instead I will encourage them to further their education for their well being. Because the value of education is priceless. However, not going to ignore the fact that it is highly expensive. I hope I can one day just be able to send my own children to a university without worrying about the cost of tuition. I hope my children will not have to work while in college like I am doing right now. All I can dream of is my children reaching further than what I did. But not only my children I hope any child can achieve this. I do not want anyone to feel that college is not meant for them because no one in their family or community has gone. I want kids to know that it is okay to be the first. Yes you will come across some challenges but you will also see the light at the end of the tunnel after every challenge you overcome. If I am ever able to make a difference in this world I will do it by changing the future of a student. I will not donate clothes to them , or buy them a car, what I will do is give them something that is priceless: provide them with the opportunity to further their education. 
<br><br>

        I want to be remembered as the person who broke down walls. That despite the world had it against her she was still able to thrive. Being a women, Mexican, and lower class, is seen as a minority. Despite it being the year two thousand and nineteen, people still expect women to serve as house wives. Or as bait for men. They think every of our actions should be taken in the thought of what a man would want us to do. I will not confirm to what is expected for me just because I am a women. I will live my life as if I was seen equally compared to a man. With this mindset of mine I will make it far in life. But in a couple years I will be seen as in inspiration to others. For the little girl with briads that grew up and became a succesful business women. I might be the next kylie Jenner , who knows right. Or I will be in a page in forbes magazine. All I can say for myself is I am dreaming big. Being in talk shows. Perhaps being the special guest in the Ellen show. Or even better being interviewed by the one and only Oprah. I want to be a business women like my idol Kim Kardashian West. She serves as inspiration because despite people trying to always put negative labels on her she doe not let herself be told what she is. Instead she challenges the labels and make people see how much of a great person she is. Some might say she is not the best type of role model to look up to. But I say other wise. Because what I see in her is a women who never stopped trying and always kept dreaming bigger. She has never settled for anything in life she always trys to improve. And recently she has been invloved with politics in attempt to change people lifes for the better and I admire her for that. It gives me hope that I can do that. As I mentioned before I want to change lifes of children in highschool. I want to provided them with education that can change their entire life around. Not only would the students life will change but aswell as the life of their future family. I want to leave this world with a legacy. It does not have to be big but I atleast want people to know I was here. I want to leave my footprints here in this world, so that others can see what I have done. I dont want to live my life with regrets. People will know what I did and thr challenges I faced to make it to the point I did. I hope I mean something in someones life. That I made a postive impact in many peoples lives. A differnnce that changed their life. I will leave my mark in this worl despite the circumstances I face.
